Theme: Home Appliances and Furniture
Our website is a shopping website where customers can view different types of home appliances and furniture. We have also included three different products in each type, so they can look into the different options they have. Clicking the name of the type will redirect to the respective products page of the type. Also there is a feedback form where the customer can submit feedback which is redirected to a Thank You page after successful submission of feedback.

Problems faced:
We had a problem in making the navigation bar. It was not setting up properly. So, we worked together and learned online on how to make it and improvised it here and made it work finally.

New things we learned:
We learned how to make better responsive pages. It really helped us learn new stuffs.
